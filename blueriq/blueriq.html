        <h2 class="thetitle">Background</h2>

        <p>This project is was given to us by Fontys. We were tasked by Blueriq to redesign the document editor, Encore. Encore is the second version of their app; the first one was called Studio, but it's outdated. Now that they're migrating from Studio to Encore, they have been adding and removing features that are necessary to increase the usability. Blueriq asked us to asisst them with this journey by trying to improve the usability of the document editor to increase the user adoption of Blueriq Encore, and  provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations to improve the usability of the document editor. So, the question is:   </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2vw;"><b>Which improvements are needed to increase the usability of the document editor?  </b></p>
    </section>

    <section id="personalobservation">
        <h2 class="thetitle">Personal Observation</h2>
        <p> I act as the user and observe my behaviour and attitude when using the document editor. After trying out the document editor, I will list the pains and gains and other insights I got.</p>
        <p><b>Pains:</b></p>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">The blue bar (with Encore logo) wasted a lot of valuable space. Also, as the blue colour is very vibrant, it can distract users        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Cannot open two documents simultaneously</p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Tree is too big, so you need to scroll to the right to access other buttons like presentation style </p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">The button for condition looks like a calculator, not making any sense.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Needs image labelling for the button next to languages.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Gains:</b></p>
        <img src="happyface.png" class="happyface"><p class="pointers">when you highlight a text and/or a content in the tree, the contents of both the tree & the document got highlighted, ensuring clarity.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 3vw;">It seems that I experience more pains than gains when using the doc editor. I will see if the business engineers also feel the same way.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="interviews">
        <h2 class="thetitle">Interviews</h2>
        <p>After knowing my take on the document editor, it's time for me to do 2 interviews with business engineers, asking their opinion on the doc editor. Here are the results. </p>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Needs the ability to preview documents</p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Inserting images is a complicated task</p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Same icons for different functions (text & inline text item icons)</p>
        <br>
        <img src="sadface.png" class="sadface"><p class="pointers">Needs document in light mode, since they're creating a document in the first place</p>
        <br>
        <img src="happyface.png" class="happyface"><p class="pointers">Love when Encore highlights the dynamic attributes on preview with the green circle</p>
        <br>
        <img src="happyface.png" class="happyface"><p class="pointers">Drag and drop function in the tree is nice</p>
        <br>
        <p>..and many more.</p>
        <p>Point is, it seems that they have more negative thoughts than positive ones towards the document editor. With these in mind, we continue to do more research.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="literaturestudy">
        <h2 class="thetitle">Literature study</h2>
        <p>I researched this article on the Laws of UX to ensure good user experience when designing. These are the laws that are relevant in context to the document editor.</p>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Laws of Similarity: Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Fitt’s law: The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Parkinson’s Law: Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent. </p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Jakob’s Law: users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

        </p>
        <br>

        <p style="margin-top: 3vw;">I also took a page on UK's government's take on design principles. Here are some of them that stood out.</p>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Do less. If there’s a reusable UI component in Encore that makes total sense, its better than reinventing the wheel everytime.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Do the hard work to make it simple. This is a big reason why we need AB testing; we designed multiple times just to see the best solution, even if there may not be a lot of difference in first glance.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Making it for everyone. Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">NOT build websites. Even though Encore is accessible on the website, it’s still a service / tool for business engineers.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../bluestar.png" class="bluestar"><p class="pointers">Be consistent, NOT uniform. We should use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible.</p>

        <p>Deriving from me & my groupmates' interview and our own observations, we devised an empathy map to gain a deeper insight on the business engineers.</p>

        <img src="userstoriesimg.png" class="imagez">
        <p style="margin-top: 4vw;">However, since this is a group project, I did not do every user story. Therefore I picked these user stories and design them later.</p>

    <section id="prototype">
        <h2 class="thetitle">Prototype</h2>
        <p>Now that I know the layout of our design, it's time to put in the colours, features from the user stories, etc. Here is the version that will be delivered to Blueriq.</p>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid #f0f0f0; width: 70vw;" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2Fopdd0MwfUOjXSeSdaMwlYU%2FDesigns%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D2%253A5%26t%3DyMmPhafk1T245FD8-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>You can see that I base my design choices based on the literature study and the people I interviewed to validate them.</p>
        <p>After I did this prototype, I combined my prototype with everyone else's prototypes. Now we can go to the next step: Testing.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 3vw;">Side note, I made another prototype where I redesigned the whole of Encore. But since Blueriq only wants us to focus on the document editor, I won't submit this prototype to them. But hopefully it still gives you an idea on <b>my take on Encore</b>, where I improve the UI and hopefully increasing the usability even more.</p>

        <h2 class="thetitle">Testing the current system</h2>
        <p>We first need to note down the time taken to do major tasks in Blueriq Encore's current document editor. We divide our group to 3 teams, each team testing 2 business engineers. Here are the average time taken to do the tasks by 6 business engineers. </p>

    <section id="testing">
        <h2 class="thetitle">A/B Testing & Usability testing</h2>
        <p>We conducted A/B testing and Usability testing and compare the results with the current system. In conclusion, the duration of doing tasks in our designs vastly improved. While some task's success rates fall lower, in general they are higher, indicating that the usability has improved.</p>
        <img src="newtime.png" style="width: 35vw;">
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="thetitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To conclude everything, we found out that a majority of the business engineers expressed more negative aspects both design and function wise than positive. After we knew their thoughts, we dived into research on the good practices and principles that make a good user experience, combined with analysing Blueriq’s direct and indirect competitors to see the aspects that make them do well. While keeping in mind these 3 important information, we designed an interactable prototype which is our proposed redesign of Encore’s document editor. This is then benchmarked with the current state of Encore, and as a result, we found out that by using our design filled with improvements, the business engineers can work with Encore with more flexibility, efficiency, and most importantly, increased usability with our design. </p>
